# MZD-AIO-Theme

A combined MZD-AIO styling based on MZD-AIO output. Trevelopment/MZD-AIO and all credit to him for the scripting!

The tweaks.sh file can be edited to comment out sections which are not required. 
Copy all folders to a fat32 formatted usb2 drive. Plug into 1 of the car USB sockets and startup the dashboard. No nead to start the engine. Wait 1-2 minutes for installation to start. Accept the initial screen prompts then let it run. The full install may take a little while. The headunit will then restart.

The code and CSS is quite easy to modify or simply replace images. If modifications are done Comment out all other install sections after line 788 to speed up update install. 

A full uninstall is availble usiong the MZD-AIO easy user interface. (Tip: use the tool with wifi disconnected due to a network issue) 

Enjoy!
